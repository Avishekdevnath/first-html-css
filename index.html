<p>I stared straight at the top right corner of the screen in front of me. “Inhale for four counts, hold for seven, exhale for eight,” she would say over the phone whenever this happened. “It’s okay, you’ll be okay,” I exhaled. “The second step is to stop negative thoughts; focus on the positive and don’t forget to breathe.” I sat back in the stiff airplane seat. The roof of the plane was not going to fall on me. The exits are not going to fly open and suck everyone and everything out, effectively throwing us out into the ocean. The most positive thought I could come up with was the thought of my grandparents. The point of the trip was to see them. They were the ones who took care of me when my parents were busy working. They were getting older and I had been told my grandfather was losing his memory. My mom wanted me to see them before it was too late. I kept telling myself I had to be there for them for all the times they were there for me. Security check and waiting to board the plane was all a blur.</p>
